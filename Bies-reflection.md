What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

Prior to the GPS session I was struggling with getting the hang of the workflow of how to get my work onto github. However, I made a cheat sheet of the step by step process and referring to that made it a lot easier for me to grasp.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

My GPS buddy Lars, helped to clarify a few things for me. For example I was going though some unnecessary steps in my workflow. He also showed me some shortcuts in my terminal that will make life a lot easier. Although I don't know that we were able to fully clarify how to resolve a merge conflict. In the end we were able to pull it off, but definitely had setbacks along the way. We are now questioning if we need to give it another run just for clarity.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

We asked several questions to our guide along the way just to make sure we were on the same page and understanding what the challenge required of us. She was very helpful and patient with us.

What still confuses you about git?

Again, clearing up a conflict. I did realize though if you follow the commands on github as to how to resolve your conflict, you will eventually get there. Its one thing to just do the work, but as to wrapping my mind around why and how continues to remain a mystery to me.


How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

My first experience in pairing went very well. I had a great partner who was patient and very willing to collaborate with me. He already taught me a few new things. He was supportive and I think we did a good job of communicating and attempting to work through each release. We stayed a little later then our session went, due to having fiesty personalities and not wanting to give up until that merge conflict was solved! We both agreed that we've been spending far more time on the challenges then expected, so it is comforting to know that someone else is in the same boat as I am.
